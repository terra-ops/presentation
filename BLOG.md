Introducing Terra
=================

Web Development, Testing, Hosting, & Scaling: Simplified.
---------------------------------------------------------

We'd like to introduce to you a tool which will fill your every need when it comes to  development, testing, hosting, and scaling websites.

This tool is not designed to do one thing.  This tool is designed to do all the things.

We believe that following best practices in web development is just too difficult.  Local environment setup is too laborious.  Testing and continuous integration take too much work to setup.  True Production hosting tools are basically non-existant.

This tool's purpose for being is to make everything easier.

This tool is called Terra.


Values
------

1. Simplicity.

  The purpose of Terra is to simplify web development as much as humanly possible.

  If we make the process of web development easier, we will not only allow more people to participate, we will improve the efficiency of everyone, even the experts.

  We aim to remove as much repetitive process as possible through automation.

2. Community Ownership.

  We at ThinkDrop do not want to "own" terra.  We want the community to own it, much like the community "owns" Drupal.

  We will not presume to know what everyone wants and needs.  Our wish is for others to join in the cause, to contribute their knowledge and experience to make Terra the best it can be.

3. Flexibility.

  We do not want terra to force users to do things a certain way. Wherever possible, we will allow those who wish to override everything that Terra does.

4. Modularity.

  We know there are many, many different ways to run a website.  Whereever possible, terra will be pluggable to support these different methods.

  Terra will have extensions to allow integration with any hosting environment, including Platforms-as-a-service like Acquia Cloud and Pantheon.

5. Scalability.

  We believe that the days of website downtime are numbered.  You should not be punished for success.  We should not be vulnerable to distributed denial of service attacks.

  With the right tools, these things are easy. It's time these tools were available in free and open source software.

6. Sustainability

  Terra is designed to abstract away the underlying technology from the interface for managing apps and environments.  It must be built in a way that will work into the future, regardless of where technology goes.

  Under a different context, terra's goal is to make the process of website maintenance more sustainable.  It is too much work to keep websites online and up to date.  With the right tools, we can simplify and automate the entire industry.
