Introducing Terra
=================

Web Development. Simplified.


Why?
----

The "DevOps Revolution" has caused an explosion of tools.

Vagrant has brought developers into the Ops world.

There's just too much stuff.

---

There are no open source tools that guide websites through the entire life cycle.

Development -> Testing -> Hosting -> Scaling



Degree of Difficulty
--------------------

Getting "local" stacks running is way too cumbersome.

Products that aim to make it simpler are way too specific.

Running Tests and Continuous Integration is way too hard.


Who?
----

Web Developers.
System Administrators.

Drupal lowers the bar
but not low enough.

You shouldn't have to be a patient genius to be able to take advantage of testing.


What?
-----



Web Development should't be this hard.

Testing




Docker 
Docker is hard.
